          <div class="poem-text">
            Your dotted inanimate cathedrals, of oriental templar power<br>
            Still stand, as if some old dynasty in a long forgotten land<br><br>

            While others fret, in conscious coil,<br>
            I lost in wood and nook<br>
            Mind spun in drunken veil,<br>
            in and out of nascent night<br><br>

            Too herald coming age, as if written on holy page<br>
            In memory, youth and sun,<br>
            dancing in the street,<br>
            laughing at all I meet<br>
            Free, yet misunderstood, old rankled firewood<br><br>

            Laugh world, at failure to launch, never started<br>
            Take wing, set free, long departed<br>
            Judge not, the rhyme, so sweet in its prime<br>
            Like rosy roses, in cold crip dawn, untimely sawn<br><br>

            Old rooms, like old lovers, I know every crack<br>
            Your tear soaked carpet, your white walls washed<br>
            Your family, gone, dissolved by time<br>
            Your frame forced view, staring at sunset and star<br>
            I gone now, behind cosmic spin, off drifting far<br><br>

            To remain, never to leave, faithful to all<br>
            Everliving castle<br>
            When aged face falls, crumbled to ground<br>
            Your bricks piled high, your unassembled mess<br>
            Look kindly on your state,<br>
            Turn sorrow to gladness, at what life brings<br>
            Oh great monument, that graced herculean kings

            Quill and sleuth, bard and barren<br>
            Road leads to sunny Avon<br>
            Green country, flowering grass, who could give the sites a pass<br>
            Beware travelers; enjoy the pretty tree's, watch the river flow, theres more to know<br><br>

            Why come wayfarer? Shakespearean pallbearer<br>
            Seek you fame, peerage or do you worship words<br>
            Regardless- simply watch the birds<br><br>

            Travel to the heart, where mighty Thames goes<br>
            Where Kings and Queens lord, a clot of knowledge grows<br>
            Find him in verse, printed signature, everlasting Vere<br><br>

            King arise, from thy mort tomb, on St Peters steps<br>
            Worms and dust shake, new dreams to come, a new page<br>
            Your words give life, mind of razor sharp, your soul for all age<br><br>

            Posthumous poet, what has the world become<br>
            Dead are the crowns, words forgot, but you are not<br>
            But fading ever near, the end, of times merciless arrow<br>
            Time is proof that nothing was, yet you remain, in all brains.<br><br>

            Celebrate the passing tides, that form at no point<br>
            Origin is key to thee, past a confluence joint<br>
            Your words, your soul, it shines alive<br>
            Likeness gone, vanity deprived, truth survives

            I saw the scope and scale of London fair,<br>
            With your spiritual sun, rising high in morning air<br>
            The mist has not yet parted, fog cloud perturb her view<br>
            Green canopy clouds below, as wood meets metal vision<br>
            Blocky and disjointed, a million minds at indecision<br>
            Whistle sweet, the birds of autumn fall, mask construction drum<br>
            Sirens wail in old London, like she come undone<br>
            Up here on top of hill, with mind free at conquered sight<br>
            Ship come aground, on Olympus might

            Your older now, time has not waited<br>
            Your teeth are black, your skin greyed and dated<br>
            Remember when all turned head, and gave you credence<br>
            Off fruit still tempts the poorer beggar<br><br>

            April air is decades past, gone adrift<br>
            When you took hand and stole errant kiss<br>
            Disaster often seals, guilty pleasure,<br>
            As eager hand is apt to find no measure<br><br>

            Thief’s love is a choice, if you think so<br>
            Disguised in friendship, now you know<br>
            Age has no wisdom, as repeated mistake<br>
            Finds vulnerable victim, a feast to partake<br><br>

            Are you in a better time, or has the best been<br>
            As seasons come, and leaves change<br>
            Weather constant, your moods strange<br><br>

            Your flaws rich, but his double, sins aplenty<br>
            Revengeful, pompous proud, jealous in love,<br>
            Time, ever ticking, never to return<br>
            Finds you perfect, in all vice,<br>
            Unique visage, a throw of the dice

            The walls of Westminster speak silence,<br>
            The coated draperies of consequence, power<br>
            Great deeds, lofty men, in that eerie tower<br><br>

            Kings and Queens, royal heads of state<br>
            Dust and bone, is their fate<br>
            Living acted tombs, vessels borne to other veils<br>
            The place, where you receive no mail<br><br>

            Darwin, who mapped the course of man,<br>
            Newton, who mapped the starry night<br>
            What dignity left, on flag stone and shallow bed<br>
            Where peasant, leers and firmly tread<br><br>

            Consecrated stone, chills the bone<br>
            Religious rights, bell pells, no soil to till,<br>
            The smell of death on nose fills<br>
            Where are trees, and cool wind blows<br>
            Deep in the crypt, of sealed woes<br><br>

            Ye gods where are the women, do they live, do they have lives<br>
            Grant the mighty Elizabeth, and a few loved wives<br>
            If women be the greater sex, you would not know<br>
            For men rule the older world, feminist do not go<br><br>

            Leave this ungodly cathedral, full of rotten meat<br>
            Human ambition, divine spectacle, brought to nought<br>
            Yet..and yet, the lines grow, the reverence thus<br>
            Minds great or small, want living idols, the very best of us

            I know not my own mind, it is a spurious devil,<br>
            That awakens often to deadly thought<br>
            For minds be mined, if not so dull, for jewels and treasure richly brought<br>
            Ego's favour is a curse, when he shines his light,<br>
            To public scorn, on stages so bright<br>
            Do I ravage this femme mystic, or do I soil my own perfumed bed,<br>
            Years on, it sinks my head<br><br>

            Shunned and shamed, friends of old fled<br>
            Weary already, dashed and spent, better off dead<br>
            What malice, cold like icy stone, no room to atone<br>
            I curse my fate, disappearing like phantasm forsake<br><br>

            What of her, sweet angel in the modern time,<br>
            That took the wrath, so quiet and true<br>
            You have taken flight, though not so high, as liked<br>
            Navie your song, though bright your impish face<br>
            That sung to me in an ill-gotten place<br><br>

            Though I weep for lost time, and these harpy vagabonds,<br>
            Now invisible as the peripheries of vision<br>
            Past be Past, never so old, as time makes amends,<br>
            For that which memory can't endure<br>
            Turn east, to rising sun, aflame, in baptised state<br>
            Turn thought, to breath, to life, to words of fate

            My muses countenance is serene, when at rest, though she never sleeps<br>
            Her body a temple, unto Apollo, bright, untouchable as the sun<br>
            If eyes be moons, hers stretch out to eternity, lunar white<br>
            Food is sweet, under her breath, her kiss a diabetics death<br><br>

            Her hair curls, a bird nest be, contorting from head to deepest sea<br>
            If faces tell time, a million years it would read<br>
            A widow wander, desperate to breed<br><br>

            An act of chastity, like a nun, virgin, unspoiled<br>
            A mob of hungry dogs, desecrated, soiled<br>
            My words are dun, next to her voice, though dun might be brass<br>
            Her dead poetry, not made to last<br><br>

            If muses could be lovers, then mine you would be<br>
            Yet fate, arriving, always destined, sees<br>
            You my focal lens, poison chalice,<br>
            Never seeing inspiration, are free<br>
            I alone, with pen and silence, know it's never me

          <div class="poem-text">
            So short the tenure of time,<br>
            On long winding, narrow way, these earth gifted days<br>
            Clock whittles humdrum hours, as Gabriel fights paradises powers<br><br>

            To come so far, to asked exhausted; why?<br>
            The reaper whispers witlessly…to die<br>
            To give so much, then fade, peacefully into greater rest<br>
            A heavy crown bestows, a heart-full test<br><br>

            There is a type of love, that blossoms short, then dies away<br>
            With kindled flame, and the promise of new day<br>
            Lillies stretch to outward arms, the sun and heavenly choir reciting palms<br><br>

            To live on, not to die, to extend out into celestial sky<br>
            Griefs be gone, never to return, as you my dear safety urned<br>
            To live a life, to work till end, your hand my eternal friend<br><br>

            Bittersweet the love that dies, for it is phoenix winged<br>
            Set free of mortal realm, and flying on Poseidon winds<br>
            No more the stress of bygone years, or the shocks and many fears<br><br>

            No more rains cold shiver, or clouds oppressive black<br>
            No more the flames of wildfire flared, or thunders clamorous crack<br>
            No more worries of grave, or longest sleep<br>
            Illness, breath or friends to weep<br><br>

            Angel girls and angel boys,<br>
            Must fade to mortal end, as time so enjoys<br>
            With youthful wings, all dancing on gods fairy strings<br>
            All so light should be, mother, memory, you are free

            You quench the comets tail, on furnace arc<br>
            Creating thirst of ages, a famished mark<br><br>

            Is beauty for eyes only or to consume,<br>
            As honey drips, into lips of bears<br>
            Let me sup, a babe at the teat<br>
            Your Magdalene nurture, so nectar sweet<br><br>

            You are an alien architect, a extraterrestrial tourist<br>
            Born of exotic sphere, not all human<br>
            Let me follow your solar steps, in blackest depths<br>
            Last aviator floating free, through that cosmic sea<br><br>

            She enchants the night, like a glow worm in a darkened grove<br>
            Dancing within a beam, white dress spinning interwove<br>

            To hike among the trees, out amongst the stars<br>
            Wading through the wood, lost from view, home so far<br><br>

            My lady is of the court, not the verdant wood<br>
            Seeks the company of culture, speaks all languages, and is never good<br>
            For her the country, is a simple kind of place<br>
            Nothing to occupy a busy mind, the aromatic air a waste<br><br>

            Let me hear her laugh, with high gay sounds<br>
            Let me see her smiling eyes, let her voice be heard over town<br><br>

            Much is said of her affairs, her dalliances the start of lusty gossip<br>
            If truth be true, and she is all they say<br>

            With your Parisian scars, and your devil memory<br>

            A river doesn’t ask for much, it doesn’t strive to be,<br>

            Cruel the hand that strikes too soon, unexpected in its sting,<br>

            Nestle in, wrap around, feel my warmth<br>
            I won’t be blamed again, that day is done<br>
            Now is memorial cello time, and you…my sun

      <p>I was lost down a ditch early in life, half-buried in the dirt of bad choices and worse luck, when a drifter wandered by and handed me a tambourine. That simple gift rattled something awake inside me. I hitched rides out east, chasing the dream of the circus ring, but they turned me away at the gate, no room for a ragged kid with no name and no tricks. So I begged on main street for scraps, until a woman from hard times took me in. She showed me what women could do when the world tried to break them, and in her place I picked up a guitar for the first time. From there I began to ramble, searching out souls who still knew the real beat of life: Blind Willie’s haunting slide, Robert Johnson’s crossroads howl, the forgotten ones who sang because they had to.</p>
      <p>I played late-night bars down by the wharf, where sailors fresh off the ships would stagger in, salt-crusted and restless. If my set went sour, one of them would pull me aside in the dim light and growl, “You gotta know how to play your axe, boy.” That was the lesson that stuck. I scrimped and saved my way back home, carrying scars and songs that finally found their shape.</p>
      <p>The music that came out of those years draws deep from the great songwriters of the last century, Dylan, Young, Springsteen, and their kin, centering on thought-provoking lyrics and melodies that twist in unexpected ways. Solo, it’s sweet folk: gentle arrangements wrapped around stories at the core of the human experience, love, loss, the long road, the quiet ache. With the band, it shifts to a folk-rock edge, each song a different shade, a different story, full of grit and lift.</p>
      <p>For the last four years I’ve played solo around Perth, honing the craft in small rooms and hidden stages, learning what lands and what lingers. In 2013 the band came together, called the Lucid Dream, and the sound found its full shape.</p>
      <p>That’s the path so far: from a ditch to a stage, from a tambourine to this. The road keeps going.</p>
