      <h2>The Myth of the Rambler</h2>
      <p>I was lost down a ditch early, then a drifter came by and taught me the tambourine. I hitched rides out east to play the circus, but they wouldn’t have me. So I begged on main street for a while till a bad-time woman took me in and showed me what women could do. I picked up the guitar at her place and began rambling around, searching out souls that knew the beat of life—Blind Willie, Shannon Noll, the forgotten people. Then I played late-night bars to sailors fresh off the wharf; if I had a bad set, they’d pull me aside and growl, “You gotta know how to play your axe, boy.” And that was that.</p>
      <p>So I scrimped and wandered my way back home to the west. There, the songs found their shape—sweet folk for the solitary hours, folk rock when the band rises like smoke from the water. Echoes of the great ones: Dylan’s riddle, Young’s ache, Springsteen’s thunder—filtered through thought-provoking lyrics and melodies that twist like backroads. Solo, it’s intimate stories of the human heart. With the Lucid Dream, each track carves its own path, never quite the same twice.</p>
      <p>Four years of solo rounds through Perth streets and venues honed the blade; the band formed in 2013 to carry the fire further. These are songs for the lost, the searching, the ones who still hear the pulse beneath the noise.</p>
